A fully functioning Opencore EFI for the Lenovo Yoga 370


Okayy so this is my first Opencore efi (Well my first EfI in general but eh). Regardless of that it is fully Funktional, except for airdrop, it is a little flumys sometimes.
I haven't been able to add the boot chime to the OpenCore drive picker, but that is probably since im inexperienced. However, this EfI stable and runs fine.
If you have improvements or Questions, please dm me or write me on Discord: knyyl. Thanks to y'all.
